Repository:
- Repository is a place where you have your all codes or kind of folder on server.
- It is a kind of folder releated to one product.
- Changes are personal to that particlular repository.

Server:
- It stores all repositories.
- It contains metadata also.

Working Directory:
- Where you see files physically and do modifications.
- At a time you can work on particular branch.

note: In other CVCS, developer generally make modification & commit their changes directly to the repository. but in GIT uses a different strategy , git does not track each n every modofied file whenever you do commit an operation git looks for the files present in staging area are considered for commit & not all the modified files.

Working Directory---(add)------->Staging Area---(commit)-------->Local Repo

Commit-ID/Version_ID/Version:
- Reference to identify each change.
- TO identify who changed the file.

Tags:
Tags assign a meanigful name with a specific version in the repository once a tag is created for a particular save, even if you create a new commit it will not be updated.

Snapshots:
- Represents some data of particluar time.
- It is always incremental i.e it stores the changes ( appended data) only not entire copy.

Commit:
- Store changes in repos, you will get on commit-id.
- It is 40digit alphanumeic characetrs.
- It uses SHA-1 checksum concept.
- Even if you change one dot commit-id will get change.
- Commit is also named as SHA1 hash.

PUSH:
 Push operation copies changes from a local repo instances to a remote or central repo. This is used to store the changes permanently into the git repo.

PULL:
 Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repo to a local machine. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repo.

Branch:
- Product is same so one reps but different task.
- Each task has one seprate branch.
- Finally merge(codes) all branches.
- Usefull when you want to work parally.
- Can create one branch on the basis of another branch.
- Changes are personal to that particular branch.
- Default branch is master.
- FIle created in workspace will be visible in any of the branch workspace untill you commit, once you commit then that file belongs to that particluar branch.

Advantages of GIT:
- Free & open source.
- Fast & small- as most of the operations are performed locally therefore it is fast.
- Security- git uses a common cryptography hash function called Secure Hash Function (SHA-1) to name & identify objects within its database.
- No need of powerful hardware.
- Easier branching: if we create a new branch it will copy all the code to the branch.

Types of Repository:
1- Bare Repo(Central Repo)
2- Non Bare Repo(Local Repo)

Bare Repository:
- store & share only.
- All central repositories are bare repo.

Non-Bare Repo:
- Where you can modify the files.
- All local repo are non-bare repo.
