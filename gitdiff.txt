1- In cvcs a client need to get local copy of source file, do not changes & commit these changes to central source on server.

In DVCS each client can have a local branch as well and have a complete history on it. Client need to push the changes to branch which will then be pushed to server repo.

2- CVCS system are easy to learn & setup.
